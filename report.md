## Introduction

For large codebases, code explainability is a major challenge. When dealing with unfamiliar codebases, it is common to spend more time learning the code than actually working with it. If a novice Python programmer attempts to read it, they may find it challenging to comprehend its behaviour. The behaviour of the source code may be better understood if the pseudo-code and flowcharts of the code were used at the same time.

With the use of Natural Language Processing, one can produce pseudocodes and flowcharts for any given Python code which can then help this process of comprehending code easier for developers. We propose to implement this application to generate pseudocodes and flowcharts as a VSCode extension so that developers can generate the pseudocode/flowcharts directly from their editors.
