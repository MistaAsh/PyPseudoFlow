## Introduction

For large codebases, code explainability is a major challenge. When dealing with unfamiliar codebases, it is common to spend more time learning the code than actually working with it. If a novice Python programmer attempts to read it, they may find it challenging to comprehend its behaviour. The behaviour of the source code may be better understood if the pseudo-code and flowcharts of the code were used at the same time.

With the use of Natural Language Processing, one can produce pseudocodes and flowcharts for any given Python code which can then help this process of comprehending code easier for developers. We propose to implement this application to generate pseudocodes and flowcharts as a web application so that developers can generate the pseudocode/flowcharts on any system that they work on.

## What is Machine Translation?

Since the 1950s, training computers to translate two natural languages have been tedious. With the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the early 2000s, this task became feasible with acceptable accuracy. Machine translation is a sub-field of computational linguistics that studies the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another. In the modern-day, machine translation is used for various translation tasks, including Google Translate, translation of the text on social media platforms, translating event proceedings in the European Commission, etc.
